### [N125A22 House](#navigation-content)

	Algarve, Portugal.
	2007, Architecture , Realized.

The EN125A22 House reimagines the relationship between architecture and various forms of mobility through its distinct design and purpose. Positioned at the intersection of key Algarve roads, the house serves as a dynamic mechanism that interacts with four mobility types. It caters to infrastructure appreciation by strategically occupying a vantage point for road and highway views, accommodates individual needs through specialized layouts, adapts to changing family dynamics, and envisions a future transformation into a community-focused hotel. The design principles include elevation for optimal views, wheelchair accessibility, efficient construction, and a dual-program layout with private and public areas.
