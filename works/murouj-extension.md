### Murouj Extension

Our architectural extension, carefully integrated with the golf course at Sahara and horse racing track, Murouj continues to captivate visitors since its completion in 2018.

The Challenge: designing with a language that complements existing restaurants, using corrugated metal and white sigma for simplicity and sophistication. By concealing mechanical equipment on the rooftop, we prioritized unobstructed views for an enchanting experience.

The Carefully planned entrances manage the flow of guests and service employees, ensuring harmony for all users while offering a safe environment to enjoy horse races while families indulge in the f&b facilities onlooking the track.
