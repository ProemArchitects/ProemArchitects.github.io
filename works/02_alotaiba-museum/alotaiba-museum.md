### Al-Otaiba Museum 

	Abu Dhabi, UAE.
	2017, Unrealized.

In collaboration with Avesta France, our team designed an exhibition standing as a tribute to the remarkable legacy of Dr. Mana Alotaiba, a distinguished individual from the UAE.  Embracing a minimalistic ethos, our design seamlessly integrates with the architectural vision of X Architects in Dubai. The core principle guiding our project is functionality, crafting an exhibition space that is both visually compelling and purposeful.

Our commitment to a clean and uncluttered environment allows the showcased elements, including Mana Alotaiba's classic cars, short films delving into his illustrious legacy, rare books, and meaningful gifts from influential figures, to take center stage. Every detail has been carefully considered to enhance the visitor's experience, inviting them to immerse themselves in the narrative of Mana Alotaiba's celebrated career. With a dedication to simplicity and intent, our collaboration with Avesta France creates a space that not only respects the architectural context but also elevates the showcased elements, encouraging guests to engage with and appreciate the richness of Mana Alotaiba's legacy on display.
