	Competition Entry 2018
	


In the backdrop of the European Year of Cultural Heritage, our design for the revitalized Fountain Plaza embraces the opportunity to restore a cherished space while honoring the interplay between past and present. The vision to transform the Largo da Praça da Fonte transcends generations, uniting the aspirations of long-standing residents and newcomers, weaving a tapestry that echoes the promises of those who once departed Reguengo with dreams of return.

We envision the Fountain Plaza as a hub, a point of convergence for new initiatives, and a catalyst for ongoing projects like the Casa/Culture Garden of Professor Benedita and the Paraquil Museum—a rejuvenated space that not only enriches Reguengo's cultural fabric but also acts as a beacon, illuminating the exceptional landmarks already gracing the

Upscaling a legacy that honors the past, connects the present, and paves the way for the future. Join us on this journey as we reimagine the Fountain Plaza, where the reverence for history harmonizes with the pulse of progress.
