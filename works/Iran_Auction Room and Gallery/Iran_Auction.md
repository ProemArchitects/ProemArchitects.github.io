##Tehran, Iran 2017

In partnership with Avesta, an innovative venture encompassing an auction room, gallery, and multiple F&B locations within a hotel connected to the world's largest mall in Tehran, Iran. The auction room and gallery stand as the focal points, seamlessly integrated with a luxury hotel and the expansive mall.

This dynamic space functions as a cultural showcase, highlighting Iranian artwork and providing a lavish setting for art collector events. The grand auction space, tailored to the owner's passion for antiques and artwork, takes center stage. Strategically positioned at the public entrance, the bookshop captivates arriving visitors, situated adjacent to an upscale fine dining restaurant that connects both the private realms of the auction room and the general gallery space.

Our scope extends beyond the interior, incorporating a skylight at the elevated entry of the hotel within the auction room. Further developing the landscape design and entry points of the exterior spaces, we ensured a seamless transition from indoors to outdoors. Extending our design expertise to crafting a modern piano room and a traditional cafe that gracefully extends into the landscape from the luxury hotel, completing a harmonious and immersive experience for visitors.
