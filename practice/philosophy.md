### Practice 

At PROEM architects, we are driven by a humble approach to architecture that respects the land and embraces sustainability . Founded in 2015 by and Architect Ricardo Camacho and Architect Sarah Behbehani our studio in Kuwait is dedicated to collaborating with others and creating meaningful architectural experiences.

Collaboration lies at the heart of our practice. We work closely with clients, fellow architects, and industry professionals to foster a dynamic exchange of ideas. By valuing diverse perspectives, we bring out the full potential of each project.

We take pride in assisting larger architecture practices, both locally and regionally, in realizing the full scope of their projects. Our expertise extends beyond design to areas such as project management, landscape and urban design and considering the public's influence. By providing comprehensive support, we help our clients achieve their goals.

Our current focus revolves around commercial projects, urban design, and landscape architecture in Kuwait by crafting spaces that contribute to the vitality of urban environments, while respecting the unique needs of each community.

Alongside our local endeavors, we actively engage in renovation architecture and participate in international architectural competitions. This global perspective allows us to constantly push creative boundaries, embracing fresh ideas and approaches.

We strongly believe in the importance of sustainability, which, for us, goes beyond mere technological solutions. Sustainability is about building with respect for the land, honoring its natural resources, and minimizing our impact. We incorporate sustainable principles when viable and suitable for each project.

At Proem Architects, we approach each project with humility; letting the design speak for itself, always striving for simplicity, elegance, and a deep connection to the environmental and social obstacles integrated with a well thought out program. Our aim is to create spaces that seamlessly blend with their surroundings and enrich the lives of those who experience them.
